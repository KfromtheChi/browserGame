## Description
'Can YOU Emoji?' is a web browser game that mimicks the traditional game of Memory but on the web (and coded completely in JavaScript)!  The idea behind it was to use a handful of Emoji character images, coupled with a bright and complimenting color scheme, as the focus.  The goal was to take this basic game and have the focus not only be familiar to most if not all players of the game, but to create a fun and engaging vibe for the player as they try to tackle the object of the game.  I am super stoked about what I put togethere here, and I do feel that my focus is pretty unique to a simple and well-known concept.  On a personal note, my nephew loves loves loves Emoji's, and is going to flip out when he finds out what his super-cool aunt created! 

Though the game of Memory is considered a fairly easy game to put together from a developer standpoint - as my first EVER coding project: this game was anything BUT for me.  Fortunately, HTML and CSS came pretty easy to me, so I had the layout and design wrapped in a couple of hours.  BUT...I am not a gamer in any way.  That's right.  Any web/internet/animation based game is just NOT my thing.  And, this game wasn't even my original game idea...To Be Continued...which also added to the challenge for me.  In short: I had to really work at the JavaScript for this project.  Kudos to all the game developers out there, I highly respect what you do!


## Technologies Used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript


## Object of the Game
The game features a PLAY button that will start and restart the game, a 1 minute timer that counts down, and 20 face-down cards that will 'flip up' to display the Emoji image when clicked.  10 Emoji images x 2 = 20 cards, 10 pairs.  The player can click two cards for each try.  If the two cards do not match, both cards will 'flip back', hiding the Emoji until the player clicks the next two cards.  If the two cards selected are a match, they will remain facing up to display the matching Emoji's. In order to win the game, the player has to match 10 Emoji pairs before the 1 minute game timer is up.  If the player can match all 10 pairs in 1 minute, they win the game.  If the player fails to match all 10 pairs in 1 minute, they lose the game.

Simple yes?  However...I did add a second challenge factor to the game in addition to the 1 minute timer: four of the eight smiling Emoji's out there have been included in the game.  The challenge in matching the smiling Emoji's is presented by the fact that all four images are similar to eachother - they are not exactly alike - but each one is similar with one or two features that differ from the others.  Game changer!  In having tested this game out myself...many times...I will say this caviat does present quite the challenge making it quite fun and competitive.  Feel free to have a Go at it yourslef!

## Future Updates
I am pretty happy with where my game is now in all honesty - however - it would be pretty cool to add the following:
- [ ] A point system
- [ ] A score board where players can enter their names to keep tally of the highest scoring player
- [ ] A challenge for players who finish before timer is up: 10 additional cards drop, if matched before remaining time is up: bonus points!
- [ ] A challenge round for players who match 10 pairs in 1min: challenge round, add 20 emojis, 1min timer, bonus points!
- [ ] Cascading Poop Emoji's down screen when player loses
- [ ] Combination Emoji's cascading down screen when player wins
